Local Tour Guide


We all have times where we sit around, bored,
thinking there's absolutely nothing to do. I've 
felt it, we'be all felt it. Well now there's a
quick and easy way to find local activities 
through the Local tour guide app. Using it,
you can quickly find activities around you by
looking at user submissions of places and 
activities posted from fellow community members,
meaning they will be revalent to you. You can also
filter activities by category so you only 
find what you are looking for.

AWS Assignment:

Was a lot more complicated setting up website than I thought it would be, overwhelming amount of information and specification options, I would be very lost without the assignment guide.

I didn't think my website would have preloaded content, I guess it is automatically loaded in when connecting to CS server

IP adress: 18.116.166.104

Still not completely sure how to use SSH and development vs production environments, have to figure that out

DNS: smartprogramming.click

Easier to navigate through the route 53 page than it was to initially set up server.

Cool how you can put anyword in front of root and it still works, http://chicken.smartprogramming.click/ is still completely valid

It's cool how caddy does all the heavy lifting for you, I do want to dig a little deeper into how it works though
