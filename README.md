Local Tour Guide


We all have times where we sit around, bored,
thinking there's absolutely nothing to do. I've 
felt it, we'be all felt it. Well now there's a
quick and easy way to find local activities 
through the Local tour guide app. Using it,
you can quickly find activities around you by
looking at user submissions of places and 
activities posted from fellow community members,
meaning they will be revalent to you. You can also
filter activities by category so you only 
find what you are looking for.

AWS Assignment:

Was a lot more complicated setting up website than I thought it would be, overwhelming amount of information and specification options, I would be very lost without the assignment guide.

I didn't think my website would have preloaded content, I guess it is automatically loaded in when connecting to CS server

IP adress: 18.116.166.104

Still not completely sure how to use SSH and development vs production environments, have to figure that out

DNS: smartprogramming.click

Easier to navigate through the route 53 page than it was to initially set up server.

Cool how you can put anyword in front of root and it still works, http://chicken.smartprogramming.click/ is still completely valid

It's cool how caddy does all the heavy lifting for you, I do want to dig a little deeper into how it works though

D to resolve changes with .swp files in vi

HTML is comprised of a bunch of tags that dictate the layout of your website/how it is organized, containers in containers.

Seems like it's impossible to remember everything, just remember what is possible and then if you want to do it look it up on internet.

Multiple different types of headers

Classes and id's don't really do anything with solely HTML, they are very useful when used with CSS and Javascript though because then you can define the behaviors of those classes.

Inline vs block elements, block takes up all space available and automatically makes new line, inline does not make a new line and only takes up as much space as neccesary, also cannot contain a block element while vice versa is true. Block is like <p> or <div>, inline is like <span> or <a>.
