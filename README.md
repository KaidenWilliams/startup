## **Startup: Mapz**

Mapz is a simple Node.js project built on express, featuring an interactive map that users can leave comments / reviews on. The underlying map provider is OpenStreetMap, and all user interactions are handled with Leaflet.Js. Mapz was built as a project for CS 260, a web development class at BYU.


Login is located in index.html and handled by index.js. The map features are located in home.html and handled by home.js.
